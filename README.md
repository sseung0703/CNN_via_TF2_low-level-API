# CNN_via_TF2_low-level-API
This project's purpose is building convolutional neural network implementation with Tensorflow2.0 low-level API only. It looks somewhat useless things because Keras layers are so easy to handle. However, I have many layers which were built in TF1 low-level API, and surely, there is no Keras layer for them. So, I have to do this, and perhaps some guys need it too.

# Require
- Tensorflow > 2.0

# To do
- write Readme and milestones.
- codes to save and load model without checkpoint.
- make the example networks such as ResNet, WResNet.
- find more things to do...
